In this project, 4 classification models were used to predict human survival in that disaster. These include:
- Supper Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
- Tree Decision

After training the models and using cross validation to calculate the errors of the models, boxplot to compare the errors when using the models:
